## Compile WASM

Get the Emscripten SDK, using these instructions: <https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html>.

Run `./compile-wasm.sh` to compile wasm module. Compiled js amd wasm files are committed to repository. So every time you change C code you need to recompile and commit updated files.
